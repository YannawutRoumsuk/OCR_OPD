# OCR_OPD
 The ocr_without_boxs.py and ocr_with_boxs.py scripts are designed for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks with similar core objectives. The key distinguishing feature is that ocr_with_boxs.py has a special capability of text boxing, which significantly enhances OCR accuracy. Text boxing allows precise definition and localization of text, reducing errors that might occur from broad, unfocused character recognition. In contrast, ocr_without_boxs.py performs OCR in a more generalized manner, without emphasizing specific text bounding, which results in potentially lower accuracy compared to the first script.
The text boxing technique provides several advantages:

Increased precision in text identification
Better handling of complex document layouts
Reduced misinterpretation of characters
More structured and controlled OCR process
